    "description": "Provides high-performance and low-allocating types that serialize objects to JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) text and deserialize JSON text to objects, with UTF-8 support built-in. Also provides types to read and write JSON text encoded as UTF-8, and to create an in-memory document object model (DOM), that is read-only, for random access of the JSON elements within a structured view of the data.\n\nThe System.Text.Json library is built-in as part of the shared framework in .NET Runtime. The package can be installed when you need to use it in other target frameworks.",
